CS1699 - Deliverable 3:
Systems Testing with BDD



Introduction

The project under test is a recipe sharing website. The site allows users to login and post recipes
as well as to search the list of recipes posted by other users and post your comments to the recipes.
We decided to test this website because we felt that its simple interface would be appropriate to use
as an introduction to selenium testing.
